# An *universal* controller for your protogen!
- Beta version
<<<<<<< HEAD
  [x] PlatformIO based for ease of use (no longer Arduino IDE)
  [x] Use of ESP32-S3 with PSRAM
  [ ] Using PSRAM (**needs testing**)
  [ ] OLED init bug fix (**needs testing**)
  [ ] Better custom WS28xx display (**designed but not manufactured yet**)
  [ ] Fix and make how to proper boop sensor (**priority**)
  [ ] Dynamic anim selector instead of dropdown (**priority**)
  [ ] Custom amount of displays and their placement
  [ ] Supported both MAX and WS28xx displays in the same codebase
  [ ] Support different sized OLED
  [ ] Replace the HM10 in the remote with something else to make it fail less (ESP??)
  [ ] Factory settings when error read
  [ ] Custom PCB remote
  [ ] More anims (Rainbow from boop,...)
  [ ] Proper wiring and flashing tutorial
  [ ] More user-friendly UI on mobile for controls
  [ ] Support for ESP32 with PSRAM soldered on / without
