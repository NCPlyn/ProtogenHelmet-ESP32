# An *universal* controller for your protogen!
- Beta version (no idea if it works now)
- [x] PlatformIO based for ease of use (no longer Arduino IDE)
- [x] Use of ESP32-S3 with PSRAM
- [x] Dynamic anim selector instead of dropdown
- [x] Using PSRAM (so far only current anim)
- [x] More user-friendly UI on mobile for controls (could be better, but will do)
- [x] Factory settings when error read and CRC checking
- [x] Online web version of animator ([HERE](https://foxxo.cz/proto/animator.html))
- [x] Fix current animations
- [x] Add function to change anims with button
- [x] Proper definitions, buggy platformio with defines (should work)
- [ ] Replace the HM10 in the remote with something else to make it fail less (ESP??) (**needs polishing**)
- [ ] Support different sized OLED (**priority**)
- [ ] OLED init bug fix (**needs testing**)
- [ ] Redo tilt calibration code (**needs testing**)
- [ ] Supported both MAX and WS28xx displays in the same codebase (**needs testing**)
- [ ] Custom amount of displays and their placement (**needs testing**)
- [ ] Support for ESP32 with PSRAM soldered on / without (**soldered on should work, without not done yet**)
- [ ] Better custom WS28xx display (**designed but not manufactured yet**)
- [ ] Auto gen CRC before filesystem upload (platformio sucks at running scripts at events, manual for now)
- [ ] Proper enable/disable of features (code wise or reset. same with remote)
- [ ] Custom PCB remote
- [ ] More anims (Rainbow from boop,...)
- [ ] Proper wiring and flashing tutorial
- [ ] Make how to proper boop sensor
- [ ] Make sure ifdef for definitons work, add definition for wifiena etc
- [ ] Proper partition tables for microcontrollers
- [ ] Boop AVG, Automatic change to boop when changed anim wtf? bug or should be like that??
  
- But I'm limited in my free time that I can give here so it will take a while!
