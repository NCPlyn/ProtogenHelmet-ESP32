# An *universal* controller for your protogen!
- Beta version
- [x] PlatformIO based for ease of use (no longer Arduino IDE)
- [x] Use of ESP32-S3 with PSRAM
- [x] Dynamic anim selector instead of dropdown
- [x] Using PSRAM (so far only current anim)
- [x] More user-friendly UI on mobile for controls (could be better, but will do)
- [x] Factory settings when error read and CRC checking
- [x] Online web version of animator ([HERE](https://foxxo.cz/proto/animator.html))
- [x] Fix current animations
- [x] Add function to change anims with button
- [x] Proper partition tables for current microcontrollers
- [x] Proper definitions, buggy platformio with defines (should work)
- [x] Auto gen CRC before filesystem upload (platformio is unpredictable)
- [x] Make sure ifdef for definitons work (should), add definition for wifiena (done), RGB orders def (wrote comment)
- [x] Support for ESP32 with PSRAM soldered on / without (**soldered works, without might never be...**)
- [x] Supported both MAX and WS28xx displays in the same codebase (**should work but needs to be kept under supervision**)
- [x] Custom amount of displays and their placement (**same as above**)
- [x] Redo tilt calibration code (**same as above**)
- [x] OLED init bug fix at runtime
- [x] ElegantOTA (**192.168.4.1/update**)
- [x] visor / blush brightness fix (ws 0-255, max 0-16)
- [x] More QOL for animator (credit to https://xantorohara.github.io/led-matrix-editor/, this is kinda built on top xD)
- [x] Remote: Convert to PlatformIO + add ElegantOTA
- [x] Remote: Buttons XIAO + PCB

- ToDo: Helmet
- [ ] Support for ToF sensor besides the ([IR](http://irsensor.wizecode.com/)) sensor
- [ ] Better custom WS28xx display (**waiting for v3, taking preorders** [RGB-Matrix](https://foxxo.cz/proto/matrix/))
- [ ] Support different sized OLED, define addreses, brightness
- [ ] Proper enable/disable of features (code wise or reset)
- [ ] More RGB anims/modes (Rainbow from boop/front, etc)
- [ ] Button from remote to change the RGB modes + show on OLED
- [ ] Put into functions/files
- [ ] Hide WS stuff if MAX is choosen
- [ ] GPIO1 hold when boot = factory (close enough)

- ToDo: Remote
- [ ] getBLE/scanBLE - timeout watchdog????
- [ ] Flex sensors
- [ ] Different modes of using the buttons
- [ ] GPIO1 hold when boot = factory (close enough)

- ToDo: Manuals etc.
- [ ] Make "How to properly place and tune proximity sensor" for boop (do not need SW fixing, all is about proper placement and tuning sensor)
- [ ] Make wiring and flashing tutorial (including fs things)
- [ ] Make uptodate parts list for most options
  
- But I'm limited in my free time that I can give here so it will take a while!
