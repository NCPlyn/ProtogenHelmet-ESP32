# An *universal* controller for your protogen!
- Beta version (doesn't work atm)
- [x] PlatformIO based for ease of use (no longer Arduino IDE)
- [x] Use of ESP32-S3 with PSRAM
- [x] Dynamic anim selector instead of dropdown
- [x] Using PSRAM (so far only current anim)
- [x] More user-friendly UI on mobile for controls (could be better, but will do)
- [x] Factory settings when error read and CRC checking
- [ ] OLED init bug fix (**needs testing**)
- [ ] Redo tilt calibration code (**needs testing or fixing**)
- [ ] Supported both MAX and WS28xx displays in the same codebase (**needs testing or fixing**)
- [ ] Custom amount of displays and their placement (**animator needs update for loading config files**)
- [ ] Support for ESP32 with PSRAM soldered on / without (**soldered on should work, without not done yet**)
- [ ] Better custom WS28xx display (**designed but not manufactured yet**)
- [ ] Auto gen CRC before filesystem upload (platformio sucks at running scripts at events)
- [ ] Proper enable/disable of features (code wise or reset)
- [ ] Online web version of animator
- [ ] Support different sized OLED
- [ ] Replace the HM10 in the remote with something else to make it fail less (ESP??)
- [ ] Custom PCB remote
- [ ] More anims (Rainbow from boop,...)
- [ ] Proper wiring and flashing tutorial
- [ ] Make how to proper boop sensor
- [ ] Make sure ifdef for definitons work, add definition for pin 13 (wifi ena)
- [ ] Add option to change anims with button
  
- But I'm limited in my free time that I can give here so it will take a while!
